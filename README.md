# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
In this is project I used a dataset of about 40,000 tweets and did sentiment analysis. The tweets were classified as racist/sexist or non racist/sexist tweets.
We used Emoticons for sentiment analysis and we used hashtags also.
We used Word cloud for visual representation of dataset and we used different ML algos for testing and later we calculated F1 score of each model
